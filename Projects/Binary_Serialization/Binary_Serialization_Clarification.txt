What DataModelingExcercise does:
	It was practice to learn (eventually) that WPF uses reflection for property change listeners to active bindings

Saving Application to JSON is: (Meant to be used for: Beta Interfaces)
	Kind of all over the place:
	1) Abstracts a bit how to serialize in JSON
	2) It takes processes and helps debug their limitations
	3) Tests out some items on how to serialize...
