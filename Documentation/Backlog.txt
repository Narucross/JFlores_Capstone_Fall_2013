October: 9th 2013 >> ~2:00 pm
Tasks:
	Finish project proposal for >> "Desktop clearner" 
	Provide proof of concepts on possibility of project
///////////

All tasks you need to do, 
==============================================
Unfinished:
	>> Multi-Select :: Able to focus on one or more applications at once.
	>> Same height and with button (Multi-Select)
	>> Create a Desktop, right-click extension or executable/"open with" files that makes certain formats available on start up. The idea is to keep DXC light and only execute when nessessary. "Do task then clean up kind of application"
	>> Check from user stories.
==============================================

\\============================================
Ideas for achieving drag and drop.
>> Processes
> By going throught System.diagnostics and processes class I am hoping to get the type of the windows for the application that is currently running

Week 4:

Put a gui in:
-- Show all the applications you can run
Stretch goal:
-- Save states

Saving Templates:
-- Personally I think formats and saved applications should be kept separate in order to give more fluid control over the program.
-- For instance in saved applications we can have a reference to a known template, and store a default template/error catch if the template we want 
	is not found in the archive. 
-- How will this improve functionality? 
	-- Templates won't need to be repeated/(additionally stored) for different types of applications
	-- We can have "quick-Change" Templates, where upon selecting multiple applications the user can quickly swap out different formats

Week 4 problems:
	>> For now templates are saved in a static place, need to find a way to make it closer to the directory
		>> One thing to try is to create an executeable and test it outside of visual studios, 
	>> Couldn't get the bean's equals method to work on an "equivalence level" need to find out what that is all about but it seems to be about c# rather then the methods

\\============================================
Week 5
0) Make-up : Application(s) presentation (that list of all applications)
 
1) Additional GUI enchancements: 
		Drag and Draw function (replace basic)
		>> Than the precursor to drag and drop
		
2) Saved programs in varied states

Stretch:
	Executable-First Step:
		First kind of executable that takes the first 4 applications on APL and re-sizes them.
