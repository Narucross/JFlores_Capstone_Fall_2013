October: 9th 2013 >> ~2:00 pm
Tasks:
	Finish project proposal for >> "Desktop clearner" 
	Provide proof of concepts on possibility of project
///////////

All tasks you need to do, 
==============================================
Unfinished:
	>> Multi-Select :: Able to focus on one or more applications at once.
	>> Same height and with button (Multi-Select)
	>> Create a Desktop, right-click extension or executable/"open with" files that makes certain formats available on start up. The idea is to keep DXC light and only execute when nessessary. "Do task then clean up kind of application"
	>> Check from user stories.
==============================================

\\============================================
Ideas for achieving drag and drop.
>> Processes
> By going throught System.diagnostics and processes class I am hoping to get the type of the windows for the application that is currently running

\\============================================
Week 4:

Put a gui in:
-- Show all the applications you can run
Stretch goal:
-- Save states

Saving Templates:
-- Personally I think formats and saved applications should be kept separate in order to give more fluid control over the program.
-- For instance in saved applications we can have a reference to a known template, and store a default template/error catch if the template we want 
	is not found in the archive. 
-- How will this improve functionality? 
	-- Templates won't need to be repeated/(additionally stored) for different types of applications
	-- We can have "quick-Change" Templates, where upon selecting multiple applications the user can quickly swap out different formats

Week 4 problems:
	>> For now templates are saved in a static place, need to find a way to make it closer to the directory
		>> One thing to try is to create an executeable and test it outside of visual studios, 
	>> Couldn't get the bean's equals method to work on an "equivalence level" need to find out what that is all about but it seems to be about c# rather then the methods

\\============================================
Week 5
0) Make-up : Application(s) presentation (that list of all applications)
 
1) Additional GUI enchancements: 
		Drag and Draw function (replace basic)
		>> Than the precursor to drag and drop
		
2) Saved programs in varied states

Stretch:
	Executable-First Step:
		First kind of executable that takes the first 4 applications on APL and re-sizes them.
		
Week 6:
-- Remarks: 
	It seems like I have a problem when accessing Windows OS type applications.
		For instance explorer keeps returning zero even though originally we know it has a handle
			Currently the problems have been: 32 bit system cannot access 64 bit systems
			&& 
			system.invalidOpertion expection to get the handle...
	>> For things like firefox, where we may want more then 1 window need to find all windows
-- Look at ink canvas
All of week 5
	Stretch Goals:
		-- Drag and drop it.
		-- 2~2:30-4
		-- Make the sliders animate the windows as they go
		
Week 7: Nov 18-22
	Tasks:
		From week 5 and 6
			Click and Draw 			-- Draw any num of rects, number them, color change them, opacity
			Click and move 			-- Select a rect, move it on click, release on offclick
		Stretch Goals:
			Drag and drop(apps) 	-- Have a panel of apps, drag and drop into a rectangle, some indication which app was dropped where
			Make sliders on prim slide actually animate windows???
// Reflections : Nov 19th
-->>	V_4_Upgrades
			-- In the current project the "intermediate" interface V2 is not compatible with drag and drop functionalities for 3 reasons:
				1) Rectangles are able to have drop handlers, however my specifications for drag and drop in the project outline state:
					-- That I have some sort of Window numbering present on the rectangles that give a more canny distingtion between other drawn rectangles
						-- Because wpf rectangles don't support text they need to be replaced with custom UserControls that is at least composed of 1 rectangle and 1 textfield
						-- Need a User control
				2) Tutorials on Drag and drop don't support or tell you how to send complex objects via the drag and drop wpf interface and it isn't likely I can complete or figure that out before checkoff
				3) Save functionality problems below
					-- Save template functionality is still on back burner because we found 32intptr logic error that makes it impossible to move native 64 bit applications. What distinguishes between 64 bit and 32 bit applications need to be reconciled and accounted for in order to make any sort of pragmatic serialization worthy of investment
	
Week 8: Nov 25- 29
	Tasks:
		Drag and drop(apps)
		Saving templates
			__ Cure 32 intptr ailment
		
		Stretch goals:
			Executables -- Save favorite templates for quick desktop setup
// Reflections Week 8
	** Useing a custom user-control I can manage that regardless of where a mouse clicks on a unit the whole thing can move as one, this way I can make sure that my zone areas will always be accompanied by thier number compatriot
		** Thank this guy for making user-control in visual studio short and simple: http://www.highoncoding.com/Home/
		** Worked as theorized but needed to disable on creation to avoid it trying to drag and create its orientation at the same time.
		
Week 9:
	Tasks:
		Saving templates up to 32 bit processes
		Drag and drop the apps from a listbox and resize them
		Executatbles
		
		Stretch:
			Cure 32 intptr ailment
			Replace list with icons make it more polished and user friendly
			
	// Week 9 Notes:
		// Drag and Drop -- At least WPF doesn't entirely support: "DropReportedSuccessful/Received" callback, so I will create my own
		// I just realized I never said that I could Load saved Templates
		// Won't be able to don executables as of Wednesday: 3:30pm
		// Saved at least can save to file, there is currently no way to load a template or to guarentee that a window rememebers its dimensions
		// Executables is still a ways off.
		// Thinking of implementing real time panning with certain windows
		
Week 10: Until Tuesday
	Tasks:
		Fix bugs with resizing
			Make canvas size, successfully mimic or represent the actual resolution and size of the Windows Desktop			
			Try making sure that isEnabled is correct or that the focus can reach certain items...
			Also Add thumbs to make it so that people are not stuck to the static sizes and allow deletes
			
		Loading saved files
			Try seeing if they have a "Java static class that allows you to file browse{filter to txt or something}
		
		Stretchgoals:	
			Executables
			Try an animation tag on panning{if bound??}
			Tabbed Pane...
			
			
	// =================================
	// By Capstone defense @ 9:00 am
	// =================================
		Finish Saving:
			- Save to a file, that I can execute with my dll :: http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/376631/How-to-make-your-own-file-type-for-your-Csharp-app
			- Tabbed Pane, but why? {Because it gives me an excuse to have a list of savedApplication wrappers in Master, and slightly clears up the func behind saving}
		Re-Size Func:
			- Just to be nice
			- Real-Scale
			Dual Screens?
			{
				Kind of how real-scale works,,, Tabbed Within a Tabbed Pane
			}
		Selecting Rectangles...
			- I could restrict it to Pan View only, but that is kind of weird...
			- Users expect to be able to left click on a rectangle and have some additional func, like right-click option menus 
				Or to be able to delete it...
				So to be honest CreateRect should be an ONInvoke only (to simply this and have selectables be available)
		Delete Rectangles...
			- And/or De-Sync Windows {Gives creedance to the events below}
		Animate pane movement:
			- 2 Events to subscribe too, (Not property change because these are specific){
				AnotherWindowHasEnteredThisDomain //AKA unsub
				MimicMovement
				}
				
		

// ===================================================================================================
// Break
// ===================================================================================================

Things to do:
Tabbed Pane : See picture on Desktop

Load up applications
MCV or something like that, should take me like 3 - 4 hours
Screen resize calibrations 1 - ++ Hours
Icons when dragged(drag preview){ 4 hours or drop it entirely if not possible
	
}
Zoom in and out	???
